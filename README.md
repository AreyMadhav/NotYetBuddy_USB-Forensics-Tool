# NotYetBuddy - Realtime USB Forensics Tool

---

## Features

- Real-time USB detection (device inserted/removed)
- Extracts device name, VID, and PID
- Logs all USB events with date/time stamps
- Flags **known malicious USB devices**
- Simple C++17 implementation using Win32 API
- Future-ready for USB power (TDP) monitoring
- Lightweight and fast; no external dependencies

---

## Use Cases

- Cybersecurity research
- USB activity auditing
- Intrusion detection for keystroke injection devices (Rubber Ducky, Bash Bunny)
- Physical access monitoring in sensitive environments
- Forensics and compliance tracking

---

## Requirements

- **Platform**: Windows 10 / 11 (x64)
- **Compiler**: MSVC with C++17 support
- **Build Tool**: Visual Studio 2019/2022
- **Linked Libraries**:  
  - `SetupAPI.lib`  
  - `Cfgmgr32.lib`

## Future Roadmap

### USB Power (TDP) Logging
- Monitor and log real-time USB port power draw
- Detect power anomalies during device injection

### Intelligent Event Classification
- Behavior-based detection of suspicious HID activity
- Logging "jailed" keystrokes from unauthorized input devices

### GUI Dashboard
- Real-time USB device view
- TDP and event graphing

### Kernel Mode Driver
- Protection against low-level USB rootkits and stealthy firmware attacks
